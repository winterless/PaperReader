LLM specialized for the financial domain has been reported in literature. In this work, we
presentBloombergGPT,a50billionparameterlanguagemodelthatistrainedonawide
range of financial data. We construct a 363 billion token dataset based on Bloomberg’s
extensive data sources, perhaps the largest domain-specific dataset yet, augmented with
## 345 billion tokens from general purpose datasets. We validate BloombergGPT on stan-
dard LLM benchmarks, open financial benchmarks, and a suite of internal benchmarks
that most accurately reflect our intended usage. Our mixed dataset training leads to a
model that outperforms existing models on financial tasks by significant margins without
sacrificing performance on general LLM benchmarks. Additionally, we explain our model-
ing choices, training process, and evaluation methodology. We release Training Chronicles
(Appendix C) detailing our experience in training BloombergGPT.

## 1 Introduction
The release of GPT-3 in 2020 (Brown et al., 2020) demonstrated the powerful benefits
of training very large auto-regressive language models (LLMs). GPT-3 had 175 billion
parameters, a hundredfold increase over the previous GPT-2 model, and did remarkably
well across a wide range of now popular LLM tasks, including reading comprehension,
open-endedquestionanswering, andcodegeneration. Thisperformancehasbeenreplicated
across several other models (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Scao et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022a).
Furthermore,evidencesuggeststhatlargemodelsexhibitemergentbehaviors; growthallows
them to acquire abilities not present in smaller models (Wei et al., 2022a). A notable
exampleofemergentbehavioristheabilitytoperformtasksviafew-shotprompting,wherea
modelcanlearnataskfromjustafewexamples. Thisabilityimproveswell-aboverandomas
weincreasethesizeoflanguagemodels. Broadlyspeaking,few-shotpromptingdramatically
expands the range of tasks supported by models and lowers the barrier to entry for users
seeking automation for new language tasks.
After GPT-3, models grew in size to 280 billion (Gopher, Rae et al., 2021), 540 bil-
lion (PaLM, Chowdhery et al., 2022), and 1 trillion parameters (Megatron, Korthikanti
et al., 2022). Work also explored other important aspects of achieving a high-performing
LLM, such as different training objectives (Tay et al., 2022b), multilingual models (Scao
et al., 2022), more efficient and smaller models (Black et al., 2022), and finding data and
parameter-efficient training sizes (Hoffmann et al., 2022).
These efforts have almost exclusively focused on general LLMs, trained on datasets
that cover a broad range of topics and domains. While these have included some datasets
for specialized domains (e.g., code (Chen et al., 2021a) or biomedical articles (Gao et al.,
2021)) the focus has been on building LLMs with broad capabilities. Recent efforts training
models using only domain-specific data have yielded models that, while much smaller, beat
general purpose LLMs on tasks within those domains, such as science (Taylor et al., 2022)
and medicine (Bolton et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2022; Lehman et al., 2023). These findings
motivate further development of models focused on specific domains.
Financial Technology (FinTech) is a large and growing area with NLP technologies
having an increasingly important role (Xing et al., 2018; Fisher et al., 2016; Dredze et al.,
2016). Financial NLP tasks (Shah et al., 2022) include sentiment analysis (Araci, 2019),
named entity recognition (Salinas Alvarado et al., 2015), news classification (Sinha and
Khandait, 2020), and question answering (Chen et al., 2021b, 2022). While the range of
tasks is similar to those found in general NLP benchmarks, the complexity and terminology
of the financial domain warrant a domain-specific system. For all of the reasons generative
LLMs are attractive in general – few-shot learning, text generation, conversational systems,
etc. – it would be valuable to have a LLM focused on the financial domain. While there are
masked language models tuned for the financial domain (Araci, 2019), no LLM has been
tuned for or evaluated on tasks for this domain.
## 1.1 BloombergGPT
We train BloombergGPT, a 50 billion parameter language model that supports a wide
range of tasks within the financial industry. Rather than building a general-purpose LLM,
or a small LLM exclusively on domain-specific data, we take a mixed approach. General

modelscovermanydomains,areabletoperformatahighlevelacrossawidevarietyoftasks,
and obviate the need for specialization during training time. However, results from existing
domain-specific models show that general models cannot replace them. At Bloomberg, we
support a very large and diverse set of tasks, well served by a general model, but the vast
majority of our applications are within the financial domain, better served by a specific
model. For that reason, we set out to build a model that achieves best-in-class results on
financial benchmarks, while also maintaining competitive performance on general-purpose
LLM benchmarks.
We achieve this goal by constructing the largest domain-specific dataset yet, drawing on
existing data creation, collection, and curation resources at Bloomberg. As Bloomberg is
primarily a financial data company, our data analysts have collected and curated financial
language documents over the span of forty years. We have extensive archives of financial
data that cover a range of topics, with careful tracking of data sources and usage rights. We
addthisdatatopublicdatasetstocreatealargetrainingcorpuswithover700billiontokens.
Using a portion of this training corpus, we train a BLOOM-style, 50 billion parameter
model designed based on guidelines from Hoffmann et al. (2022) and Le Scao et al. (2022).
We validate the model on standard LLM benchmarks, open financial benchmarks, and a
suiteofBloomberg-internalbenchmarksthatmostaccuratelyreflectourintendedusecases.
Our results demonstrate that our mixed training approach leads to a model that vastly
outperforms existing models on in-domain financial tasks while being on par or better on
general NLP benchmarks.
## 1.2 Broader Contributions
Beyond the construction of a LLM for financial data, our goal is to contribute to the
broaderresearchcommunity. Specifically,ourexperiencedocumentedinthispaperprovides
evidence that further develops the community’s understanding of several open questions in
the literature.
Domain-specific LLMs. The few existing domain-specific LLMs are trained exclusively
on domain-specific data sources (Luo et al., 2022; Bolton et al., 2023; Taylor et al., 2022),
or adapt a very large general purpose model to domain-specific tasks (Singhal et al., 2022;
Lewkowycz et al., 2022). Our alternative approach – training an LLM on both domain-
specificandgeneraldatasources–hasnotbeenstudiedsofar. Theresultingmodeldoesvery
well on domain-specific tasks, but also maintains strong performance on general-purpose
benchmarks.
Training data. Nearly all language models rely in large part on web-scraped data, such
as C4 (Raffel et al., 2020) and The Pile (Gao et al., 2021) (which includes OpenWebText2).
Thisdatamaybecleanedorsubsettedinvariouswaysbeforeuse(Touvronetal.,2023;Rae
et al., 2020; Scao et al., 2022; Jernite et al., 2022), but issues of data duplication (Carlini
et al., 2020) and toxic language remain (Welbl et al., 2021). Our training data is unusual
for LLM training in that it includes a significant amount of curated and prepared data from
reliable sources.
Evaluation. LLM evaluation remains a challenging and evolving problem (Gehrmann
et al., 2022; Goyal et al., 2022), with new benchmarks trying to standardize evaluation

across models (Liang et al., 2022; Srivastava et al., 2022). However, for domain-specific
tasks, there remains a mismatch between evaluation and actual use cases. Evaluations are
built on available datasets and not necessarily on how the model will be used in practice.
WeprovideresultsonbothpublicfinancialNLPbenchmarks(Shahetal.,2022;Chenetal.,
2021b) as well as a selection of internal Bloomberg tasks, which are better aligned with our
intended use cases and directly evaluate our model’s ability to perform tasks of interest.
Model Size. Early LLMs made a single training pass over a corpus of 200-400 billion to-
kens(Brownetal.,2020)andHoffmannetal.(2022)positedthatmodelswereundertrained,
instead focusing on training smaller models with more data, a strategy most recently em-
ployedbyTouvronetal.(2023). WeselectamodelsizemotivatedbyHoffmannetal.(2022)
and train a 50 billion parameter model on 569 billion tokens from our corpus of over 700
billion tokens to produce a model that is competitive with larger models.
Tokenizer. After assembling training data, the critical step of tokenization transforms
the text into a format suitable for the language model. The importance of this step is
often overlooked (Mielke et al., 2021), and many older LLMs use the same tokenizer and
vocabulary, meaning that we have little evidence to support other tokenizers. We take
a different approach and use a Unigram model instead of greedy merge-based sub-word
tokenizers since it saves probabilities allowing for smarter tokenization at inference time
(Kudo, 2018).
Model Building Challenges. GPT-3 and subsequent models were the work of large
teams and required an enormous amount of computation. Initial work to reproduce these
results, such as OPT (Zhang et al., 2022a), did not match the performance of the original
model. With the release of each subsequent model, the community’s understanding, ex-
perience, and software tools increase. In developing BloombergGPT, we benefited from
existing code developed as part of the BLOOM effort (Scao et al., 2022), showing that a
moderately sized team can produce a competitive model on domain-specific data. We de-
scribeourexperiencestrainingBloombergGPTindetailtosupportfuturetrainingefforts
and address each of the above topics.

FinPile with public data widely used to train LLMs. The result is a training corpus that
is roughly half domain-specific text and half general-purpose text. For a breakdown of the
full training set, see Table 1. To improve data quality, we de-duplicate each dataset (The

## 2.1 Financial Datasets (363B tokens – 51.27% of training)
The Bloomberg Terminal has provided access to a comprehensive set of diverse structured
and unstructured financial data and analytics for the past four decades. In serving this
mission, Bloomberg analysts have curated a set of financial documents that were either
created internally or acquired from external sources. We utilize this extensive collection of
curated and maintained documents to create FinPile, which consists of company filings,
financial news, and other data relevant to the financial markets.
Some documents included in the FinPile, such as company filings, are available to
the general public, although collecting these documents and pre-processing them for LLM
trainingisanon-trivialtask. Otherdocuments,suchas(asubsetof)Bloombergnews,must
be purchased. The rest of the documents are private and available, among other sources,
through the Bloomberg Terminal. Finally, we clean this data to strip off markup, special
formatting, and templates.
Note that each document in FinPile is time-stamped, with dates ranging from 2007-
03-01 to 2022-07-31; the quality and quantity of documents increase over this time range.
While we do not utilize date information in this work, we plan to use it in the future,
such as for evaluation of what the model learns about different time periods. While we
cannot release FinPile, our experience training on a large, carefully curated, and clean
domain-specific dataset may provide helpful insights to the community on the advantages
and challenges of building a financial LLM in particular, and a domain-specific model in
general. Weprovideabreakdownandanalysisof FinPileinTable2andabriefdescription
of the types of data included below.
## 2.1.1 Web (298B tokens – 42.01% of training)
Bloomberg collects web content by identifying sites that contain financially relevant infor-
mation. Whilethiscategorymakesupthemajorityof FinPile,itsclassificationsarerough,
with content classified mainly by the location of the web domain. Within these location-
specificsources, e.g. “US”(15.95%oftotal), “Asia-Pac”(4.72%oftotal), and“UK”(1.98%
of total), document types are highly varied as would be expected from a web crawl. While
web sources are common in existing public LLM training datasets, Bloomberg’s web crawl
is focused on high-quality websites that have financially relevant information, as opposed
to a general-purpose crawl of the web.
## 2.1.2 News (38B tokens – 5.31% of training)
The News category includes all news sources excluding news articles written by Bloomberg
journalists. Overall, there are hundreds of English news sources in FinPile including
“Bloomberg Transcripts” (0.41% of total), which are transcripts of Bloomberg TV news.
Generally,thecontentinthisdatasetcomesfromreputablesourcesofnewsthatarerelevant

to prepare and submit their financial statements on a regular cadence; e.g., 10-K annual
reports and 10-Q quarterly reports. In our dataset, a majority of the filings come from
EDGAR, which is the SEC’s online database (1.90% of total). Filings are typically long
PDF documents with tables and charts that are dense in financial information, which are
processed and normalized in Bloomberg. Filings are substantially different from the types
of documents typically used to train LLMs, but contain critically important information for
financial decision-making.
## 2.1.4 Press (9B tokens – 1.21% of training)
ThePresscategorycontainspressreleasestypicallyissuedbycompaniesthatarefinancially

cations of a company. However, unlike filings, press releases are similar to news stories in
terms of content and style.
## 2.1.5 Bloomberg (5B tokens – 0.70% of training)
This category comprises Bloomberg authored news and other documents such as opinions
and analyses. The largest sources are “Bloomberg News” (0.44% of total) and “Bloomberg
First Word” (0.13% of total), the Bloomberg-authored wire of real-time news. While
Bloomberg News covers a wide range of topics, it typically focuses on content relevant
to the financial community. This dataset contains documents of varying lengths.

## 2.2 Public Datasets (345B tokens – 48.73% of training)
We use three widely known and available public datasets in our training corpus.
## 2.2.1 The Pile (184B tokens – 25.9% of training)
The Pile (Gao et al., 2021) is the dataset used in GPT-Neo (Black et al., 2021), GPT-
J (Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021), and GPT-NeoX (20B) (Black et al., 2022). We include
ThePileinourtrainingdataforthefollowingreasons. First,ithasbeenusedtosuccessfully

it includes multiple domains and we believe such diverse data will aid generalization to new
domains and may even support training on financial data. For example, domains such as
FreeLaw and GitHub are useful to teams at Bloomberg that work on legal documents and
softwaredevelopment, respectively. CreatorsofThePilehavedeliberatelychosentoinclude
duplicate content, with the duplication factor being proportional to the perceived quality
of the content. However, as we deduplicate each of our datasets, the size of The Pile is
significantly reduced. Additionally, note that our tokenizer (§2.3) is trained on The Pile.
## 2.2.2 C4 (138B tokens – 19.48% of training)
TheColossalCleanCrawledCorpus(C4)isacommondatasetusedtotrainLLMs, andwas
introduced to support training T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). Although it overlaps with Pile-CC,
C4 is cleaned and processed differently; hence, we feel that including C4 in addition to
The Pile can add value more than duplicated documents would. We find that C4 contains
high-quality natural language documents due to the layers of cleaning, though others have
noted that the distribution across web domains is unusual, with a high fraction of data
stemming from patents (Dodge et al., 2021).
## 2.2.3 Wikipedia (24B tokens – 3.35% of training)
Both The Pile and C4 include out-of-date copies of Wikipedia, so it could be beneficial for
the factuality of the model to have up-to-date Wikipedia pages included. Therefore, we
include a dump of English Wikipedia from July 1, 2022. This dataset is tokenized quite
inefficiently (3.06 characters per token), indicating an above-average amount of markup,
which suggests that further cleaning might benefit future model training.
## 2.3 Tokenization
We choose the Unigram tokenizer (Kudo, 2018) instead of a greedy merge-based sub-word
tokenizer, suchasBytePairEncoding(BPE)(Sennrichetal.,2016)orWordpiece(Schuster
and Nakajima, 2012; Wu et al., 2016), based on promising results in Kudo and Richardson
(2018) and Bostrom and Durrett (2020). Following GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), we treat
our data as a sequence of bytes rather than Unicode characters, and we include each of the
256bytesastokens. Inapretokenizationstep,theinputbytesequenceisbrokenintochunks
bygreedilymatchingthefollowingregularexpression: [ A-Za-z]+|[0-9]|[^A-Za-z0-9]+.
ThisfollowsGPT-2inpreventingmultiplecharacterclassesfromappearinginasingletoken.
However, we include spaces in the alphabetic chunks, which allows multi-word tokens to be
learned, increasing information density and reducing context lengths. The pretokenization

match earlier tables.
follows the approach of PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022) in placing each digit in its own
chunk, with the hope that this will lead to better handling of numbers. We train our
tokenizer on The Pile (Gao et al., 2021) as it draws from diverse domains, including code
and academic papers, in proportions that suit our use case.
Parallel Tokenizer Training. The Unigram tokenizer implementation is too inefficient
to process the entire Pile dataset at once, so we use a split and merge approach. We split
each of the 22 domains in the Pile into 256 chunks of roughly equal size. We then train
a Unigram tokenizer with a vocabulary size of 65,536 (216) on each of the 22×256 (total
= 5,632) chunks. We hierarchically merge the individual tokenizers by first merging the
## 256 tokenizers from each domain, and then combining the 22 resulting tokenizers to get the
final tokenizer.
Unigram tokenizers amount to probability distributions over tokens (i.e. unigram lan-
guage models), and we merge tokenizers by taking a weighted average of the probabilities
of corresponding tokens, with the weights determined by the relative sizes (in bytes) of
the data used to train the tokenizers. The result is a tokenizer with 7 million tokens. To
reduce the size of the vocabulary to 217 tokens, we drop the tokens with the smallest prob-
abilities and renormalize. To ensure we do not need an out-of-vocabulary token, we also
add as tokens the 36 (of 256 possible) bytes that do not occur in The Pile, along with an
<|endoftext|> token.
There are various considerations in choosing the vocabulary size. One advantage of a
large vocabulary for LLMs is that more information can fit into the context window. On
the other hand, there is overhead with a larger vocabulary: a larger proportion of model
parameters are required for token embedding. We select our vocabulary size of 217 tokens
basedonexperimentswithvocabularyrangingfrom25,000to550,000. Foreachvocabulary
size, we tokenize the C4 dataset and compute the total size (in bytes) for the dataset, where
each token is represented using log (vocabulary size) bits. Our heuristic is to choose the
vocabulary size that leads to the smallest encoded representation of C4. This gives us a
vocabularysizeof125,000,whichwethenrounduptothenearestpowerof2(217,or131,072
tokens). Our tokenizer is large, relative to the standard vocabulary size of approximately
50,000 tokens. For an analysis of tokenization efficiency, see Table 3.

## 3 Model
## 3.1 Architecture
Our model is a decoder-only causal language model based on BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022).
We present an overview of the architecture, with full details in Appendix A.
The model contains 70 layers of transformer decoder blocks defined as follows:
h¯ = h +SA(LN(h ))
ℓ ℓ−1 ℓ−1
h = h¯ +FFN(LN(h¯ ))
ℓ ℓ ℓ
where SA is multi-head self-attention, LN is layer-normalization, and FFN is a feed-forward
network with 1-hidden layer. Inside FFN, the non-linear function is GELU (Hendrycks and
Gimpel, 2016). ALiBi positional encoding is applied through additive biases at the self-
attention component of the transformer network (Le Scao et al., 2022). The input token
embeddings are tied to the linear mapping before the final softmax. Following Le Scao
et al. (2022) and first used in Dettmers et al. (2022), the model has an additional layer
normalization after token embeddings, formally:
h¯ = LNem(h )+SA(LN(LNem(h ))),
1 0 0
whereh istheinitialtokenembeddingandLNem isthenewcomponentofembeddinglayer-
normalization. Notice that the second term includes two consecutive layer-normalizations.

GPU hours on 40GB A100 GPUs. Since we adopt activation checkpointing to reduce our
memory footprint, this costs us an additional 0.33x TFLOPs per iteration due to repeated
forward passes. To account for this additional cost, we plug in 0.75 × 1.3M into Chinchilla
equations instead of the full amount.
From Hoffmann et al. (2022), we use the data reported in Table 3 for Approach 1 and
Table A3 for Approach 2, and fit regression lines to their log-scaled versions. This gives us:
Approach 1 Parameters = exp (log (FLOPs)·0.498−1.004) = 52.993B
10 10
Tokens = exp (log (FLOPs)·0.502+0.229) = 1111.112B

10 10
Tokens = exp (log (FLOPs)·0.510+0.062) = 1175.766B

~
These calculations imply that our dataset of 700B tokens is too small for a “Chinchilla
optimal” configuration given our compute budget (assuming just one pass through the
data).1 While we can increase the amount of general-purpose training data, we are limited
in the amount of domain-specific training data at our disposal. FinPile is already among
the largest domain-specific training sets, and we do not want it to represent less than half
of our total training.
## 1. ThescalinglawderivedbyChinchillaistokenizer-specific. Ourtokenizercanencodethesamedocument
morecompactlyduetothesupportofmulti-wordexpressionsandthelargervocabularysize. It’sstillan
open question how well these scaling laws transfer across tokenizers, and how vocabulary size impacts
token and parameter trade-offs assuming fixed compute. We leave this exploration to future work.

Since we are data limited, we choose the largest model that we can, while ensuring that
~
we can train on all our tokens and still leave 30% of the total compute budget as a buffer
for unforeseen failures, retries, and restarts. This leads us to a 50B parameter model, which
is also roughly the Chinchilla optimal size for our compute budget. Figure 1 provides a
summary of the scaling laws and how BloombergGPT compares to other models.
Shape. To determine how to allocate the 50B parameters to different model components
(i.e., the “shape” of our model), we follow Levine et al. (2020), who propose that for a total
number of self-attention layers L, the optimal hidden dimension D is obtained by:
D = exp(5.039)exp(0.0555·L)
We sweep L over a range of integer values and pick the (L,D) combination that yields
~
a total of 50B parameters. This leads to the choice of L = 70 and D = 7510 as our
target shape parameters. However, we also want to follow the tradition that the hidden
dimension is evenly divisible by the number of attention heads, with the quotient giving
the attention head dimension. Furthermore, we want the dimensions to be multiples of 8
to achieve higher performance in Tensor Core operations (NVIDIA, 2023). We settle on 40
heads, each having a dimension of 192, resulting in a total hidden dimension of D = 7680
and a total of 50.6B parameters. Table 4 provides a summary of the hyper-parameters used
in BloombergGPT.
## 3.3 Training Configuration
Training. BloombergGPT is a PyTorch model trained with a standard left-to-right
causal language modeling objective. Following Brown et al. (2020), we want all our train-
ing sequences to be exactly the same length, in our case 2,048 tokens, to maximize GPU
utilization. To achieve this, we concatenate all our tokenized training documents with an
<|endoftext|> token as a document separator. We then break this token sequence into
chunks of 2,048 tokens. Note that with this approach, each training sequence may contain
multiple documents from different domains. Also note that, because we’re using ALiBi
positional encoding, BloombergGPT can be applied to sequences longer than 2,048 at
inference time. For optimization efficiency, training sequences are grouped together into
batches, as described in more detail below.
Optimization. We use the AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2019). We set
β to 0.9, β to 0.95, and weight decay to 0.1. Following Brown et al. (2020), we set the
1 2
maximum learning rate to 6e-5 and use the cosine decay learning rate scheduler with linear
warmup. We warm up the learning rate in the first 1800 steps. Following Hoffmann et al.
(2022), the final learning rate is 0.1x the max learning rate, i.e. 6e-6. We also employ batch
size warmup (Brown et al., 2020): in the first 7,200 steps, weuse a batchsize of 1,024 (2.1M
tokens), then switch to a batch size of 2,048 (4.2M tokens) for the remainder of training.
We set dropout to 0.0 in all layers in our initial run, although we add dropout later as
explained in §4. The model parameters are randomly initialized to samples from a normal
(cid:112)
distribution with zero mean and standard deviation 1/(3D) = 0.006588 (Smith et al.,
2022). Following Megatron-LM (Shoeybi et al., 2019), we rescale the standard deviation
√
of the second layer in the MLP and the output layer of the attention by 1/ 2L. We use

the technique of query key layer scaling (Shoeybi et al., 2019), which was proposed to
improve numerical stability for FP16 mixed-precision training but may also help in BF16.
Training Instability. LLMs optimization requires running convex optimization algo-
rithms over incredibly complex non-convex loss surfaces. Previous work has reported vari-
ous instabilities while training LLMs. For example, Chowdhery et al. (2022) found that the
loss spiked roughly 20 times while training PaLM, despite the fact that gradient clipping
was enabled. They mitigated these issues by re-starting training from a checkpoint roughly
## 100 steps before the spike started, and then skip 200–500 data batches. They hypothesized
that spikes occur due to the combination of specific data batches with a particular model
parameter state. Similarly, during OPT training, Zhang et al. (2022a) noticed spikes in the
gradient and activation norms, or divergences in the training perplexity. After these behav-
iors, they lowered their learning rate, which stabilized these norms and allowed training to
continue. Interestingly, Scao et al. (2022) report only a single loss spike, from which the
model recovered on its own.
Hardware Stack. We use the Amazon SageMaker service provided by AWS to train and
evaluate BloombergGPT. We use the latest version available at the time of training and
train on a total of 64 p4d.24xlarge instances. Each p4d.24xlarge instance has 8 NVIDIA
40GBA100GPUswithNVIDIANVSwitchintra-nodeconnections(600GB/s)andNVIDIA
GPUDirect using AWS Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) inter-node connections (400 Gb/s).
Thisyieldsatotalof51240GBA100GPUs. Forquickdataaccess, weuseAmazonFSXfor
Lustre, which supports up to 1000 MB/s read and write throughput per TiB storage unit.
## 3.4 Large-scale Optimization
TotrainBloombergGPT,whichhasalargermemoryfootprintthanavailableGPUmem-
ory on cloud instances, we rely on stage 3 of ZeRO optimization (Rajbhandari et al., 2020).
We utilize the proprietary SageMaker Model Parallelism (SMP) library from AWS, which
enables the automatic distribution of large models across multiple GPU devices and in-
stances (Karakus et al., 2021). After experimenting with various techniques, we achieve
## 102 TFLOPs on average and each training step takes 32.5 seconds. We find the following
setup to be the best performing in our training.
ZeRO Optimization (stage 3). ZeRO shards the training state (model parameters,
gradients, and optimizer state) across a group of GPUs. We shard a model across 128
GPUs, and we have 4 copies of the model during training.
MiCS. Zhang et al. (2022b) decrease training communication overhead and memory re-
quirements for cloud training clusters. MiCS includes such features as hierarchical commu-
nication, 2-hop gradient update, scale-aware model partitioning.
Activation Checkpointing. Chenetal.(2016)minimizestrainingmemoryconsumption
by removing activations at the expense of additional computation during backward passes.
When a layer has activation checkpointing enabled, only the layer input and outputs are
kept in memory following a forward pass, while any intermediate tensors are discarded from
memory. During the backward pass, these intermediate tensors may be recomputed. We
apply activation checkpointing to each transformer layer.

Mixed Precision Training. Toreducethememoryrequirements,forwardandbackward
passes are done in BF16, while parameters are stored and updated in full precision (FP32).
The ALiBi matrices are computed in full precision and stored in BF16. We also use FP32
to calculate fused softmax in the Attention block and store its results in BF16. Finally, the
softmax calculations in the loss function are computed in FP32.
Fused Kernels. Another possibility for optimization is combining composition of several
operations into a single GPU operation. This can both reduce peak memory usage by
avoiding storage of intermediate results in the computation graph, as well as help improve
speed. Similar to Megatron-LM (Shoeybi et al., 2019), we use a masked-causal-softmax
fused kernel in SMP in the self-attention module. In practice, we observe 4-5 TFLOPs
improvement for speed, and avoid out-of-memory errors given the rest of the configuration.
## 4 Training Run
The process of training BloombergGPT involved decisions along the way based on the
progressofmodeltraining. Wesharesomehighlightsofthisprocess. Adetailedpresentation
appears in the Training Chronicles (Appendix C). Figure 2 shows the learning curves for
both training and validation sets. The solid lines show (smoothed) training loss and the
dotted lines show loss on the held-out validation set. Changes in the color of the lines

indicate changes to the optimization hyperparameter configurations, either as scheduled, or
in response to increasing or stagnating validation loss. This plot shows the path taken by
the successful model training run. To present a clear plot, the Figure does not show other
attempts with different model configurations, overwritten partial runs after a rollback, or
other training strategies not utilized in the final model.
We measured training loss every five steps on the current batch. The raw values vary
wildly, causing large jitter when plotted. The plot smoothes the training loss by showing
a running average y =

validation loss since it is measured on the entire validation set every 300 steps.
~
We trained for a total of 139,200 steps ( 53 days) and ended model training after
~
completing 80% of one epoch through our training data (569B tokens out of the 709B
tokens available). We ended training early because the loss on our held-out development
set was no longer improving, although it’s possible that substantially longer training may
have yielded further improvements.
We began the run with a warm-up batch size of 1,024 for 7,200 steps, after which we
switched to the regular batch size of 2,048 (color changes from black to blue). Change in
batch size manifests as a visible curvature change in the validation loss at step 7,200. Most
of the remainder of the training performed stably with decreasing training and validation
losses. Intervention was required at later stages, after step 115,500, when we observed
flat or increasing validation loss. We then applied the following corrective modifications in
sequence:
• Step 115,500 (blue to orange): Shrink learning rate to two-thirds
• Step 129,900 (orange to green): Halve learning rate, and add dropout (with 0.1 prob-
ability)
• Step 137,100 (green to red): Halve learning rate again
We ended the run at step 146,000 based on the lack of observable progress on the validation
loss. We selected the checkpoint at step 139,200 as the final model based on validation loss
and downstream evaluations.
## 5 Evaluation
We evaluated the performance of BloombergGPT on two broad categories of tasks:
finance-specific and general purpose. The finance-specific tasks help us test our hypoth-
esis that training on high-quality finance-specific data will yield better results on financial
tasks. The general purpose tasks investigate whether the performance of our model is
directly comparable to previously published results. For financial tasks, we assembled pub-
licly available financial datasets that include a range of NLP tasks. Then, to directly test
BloombergGPT’s ability on Bloomberg tasks of interest, we also included tasks drawn
from Bloomberg-internal high-quality evaluation sets for sentiment analysis and named en-
tity recognition. For general-purpose tasks, we draw from multiple existing benchmarks
and group results into the following categories: BIG-bench Hard, Knowledge Assessments,
Reading Comprehension, and Linguistic Tasks. The number of tasks per type and the
definitions of the groups are presented in Table 5.

Suite Tasks What does it measure?
Public Financial Tasks 5 Public datasets in the financial domain
Bloomberg Financial Tasks 12 NER and sentiment analysis tasks

Reading Comprehension 5 Testing open-book tasks
Linguistic Tasks 9 Not directly user-facing NLP tasks
Table 5: Evaluation Benchmarks. We evaluate BloombergGPT on a high-coverage set
of standard benchmarks that assess downstream performance, taken from HELM,
SuperGLUE, MMLU, and the GPT-3 suite. Since these have significant overlap
and/or include each other, we restructure them into the categories presented here.
We only evaluate on one setup per dataset. We further assess BloombergGPT
on a suite of internal and public financial tasks.

Table 6: Evaluationmodelcohort. OPTandBLOOMeachhavemultiplesizesavailableand
we report those we evaluated. We note that compute numbers are only partially
comparable between models: For example, BLOOMs training data is only 1/3
English, and OPT repeated some of its training data. We report GPT-3 results
whenever available but did not run it ourselves due to lack of availability.
We compare BloombergGPT to the three closest models described in §7 based on
model size, type of training data, overall performance, and most importantly, access. An
overview of the model sizes and compute is provided in Table 6.
## 1. GPT-NeoX (Black et al., 2022): According to Liang et al. (2022), this model is the
best performing available model under 50B parameters.
## 2. OPT (Zhang et al., 2022a): We chose to compare to OPT since our model size
66B 66B
and structure roughly match, though our model is smaller.
## 3. BLOOM (Scaoetal.,2022): WhilethismodelissubstantiallylargerthanBloombergGPT,
176B
we use the same model architecture and software stack. We note that BLOOM is
176B
multilingual, sowhileitismuchlarger, italsoistrainedondatafrommorelanguages.

All three models use some of the same general-purpose datasets we use in our training cor-
pus. We additionally report results from the original GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) whenever
externally available.2
We prefer running models ourselves to ensure identical evaluation setups, and we place
any results that have been reported elsewhere and were not run by us into a separated
group. To fairly compare the models, we avoid any tuning of prompts and other techniques
that could lead to improved results for some, but not all, models. For that reason, every
task is tested via “standard” prompting (shown in Table 7), i.e., without any parameter
changes to the underlying model, without task descriptions, and without Chain-of-Thought
prompting (Wei et al., 2022b). The number of few-shot examples presented to the model
depends on the task, and we include these details in the respective sections. For each group
of results, we further present a win rate similar to Liang et al. (2022) that represents the
fraction of “wins” in side-by-side comparisons over individual tasks between all model pairs
for which we have run the evaluation ourselves.
## 5.1 Few-shot Methodology
For tasks where a set of candidates are given, we perform likelihood-based classification,
following Brown et al. (2020). We consider three methods for classification: regular, cali-
bration, and normalization. Formally,
• Regular: argmax p(α|s)
α
• Calibration: argmax p(α|s)/p(α|“Answer:”)
α
• Normalization: argmax p(α|s)/len(α)
α
where α is a candidate, s is the context, and len measures the number of sub-word tokens.
We report the performance of the best method for each model and task. For other tasks,
we perform generation via greedy decoding.
We use the official split and report performance on the test set whenever possible. If
the test labels are not publicly available, we report performance on the dev set instead. If
an official split for a dataset does not exist, we create train and test splits by selecting 20%
of examples to be the test and the rest as train. All few-shot context examples are sampled
from the training set. To reduce the variance of few-shot evaluation, we sample different
shots for each test example, unless otherwise specified. For the sake of consistency, for each
test example, all models have identical surface form as input in our evaluation.

## 5.3 Financial Tasks
The NLP tasks most often considered in finance are also common in the broader NLP liter-
ature; but, these tasks take on different characteristics and challenges when performed on
financial data. Take the example of sentiment analysis, where a headline such as “COM-
PANY to cut 10,000 jobs” portrays negative sentiment in the general sense but can at times
be considered positive for financial sentiment towards COMPANY, as it might result in the
stock price or investor confidence increasing. We use a combination of public and internal
benchmarkstoassesstheperformanceof BloombergGPT,BLOOM ,GPT-NeoX,and

## 5.3.1 External Financial Tasks
Our public financial benchmarks include four tasks from the FLUE benchmark (Shah et al.,
2022) and the ConvFinQA dataset (Chen et al., 2022). As LLM performance on most of
these financial tasks have not been broadly reported, there is no standard testing frame-
work. Thus, we adapt them to a few-shot setting (see Section §5.1). Our guiding principle
in designing the experiments was to select the number of shots such that the average per-
formance across all the models was best. While non-LLM numbers of custom models for
these tasks are available, we omit reporting them here due to differences in the evaluation
setup. As a result, our claims are restricted to comparisons of LLMs. We evaluate on the
following tasks (more details provided in Appendix B):
• FPB (Malo et al., 2014): The Financial Phrasebank Dataset includes a sentiment
classificationtaskon sentencesfromfinancialnews. Anynews thatcouldbenefit/hurt
an investor is considered positive/negative and neutral otherwise. We create our own
splits and report F1 score weighted by support in a 5-shot setup.
• FiQA SA (Maia et al., 2018): The second sentiment analysis task is to predict the
aspect-specific sentiment in English financial news and microblog headlines, which
were published as a part of the 2018 challenge on financial question answering and
opinion mining. While the original dataset is annotated on a continuous scale, we
discretize the data into a classification setup with negative, neutral, and positive
classes. Like with FPB, we create our own splits including microblogs and news, and
use a 5-shot setup, reporting weighted F1.

• Headline (Sinha and Khandait, 2020): This is a binary classification task of whether
a news headline in the gold commodity domain includes certain information. This
human-annotateddatasetconsistsofEnglishnewsheadlinesabout“gold”. Eachnews
article carries a subset of the following tags: “price or not”, “price up”, “price down”,
“price stable”, “past price”, “future price”, “past general”, “future general”, “asset
comparison”. We verbalize each tag into a question using the official documentation,
use 5 shots, and report the average weighted F1 score across all categories.
• NER(SalinasAlvaradoetal.,2015): Thisisanamedentityrecognitiontaskonfinan-
cial data gathered for credit risk assessment from financial agreements filed with the
SEC.TheannotatedentitytypesfollowthestandardCoNLLformat(TjongKimSang
and De Meulder, 2003) and are annotated with PER, LOC, ORG, and MISC. As it
is nontrivial to learn to predict empty outputs in few-shot setups, we drop sentences
that do not contain any entity. We further drop MISC tags due to their ambiguous
definition. All the models required more shots to perform well and we thus selected
## 20 shots and report the entity-level F1 score.
• ConvFinQA (Chen et al., 2022): Given input from S&P 500 earnings reports that
includes text and at least one table with financial data, the task is to answer conver-
sational questions that require numerical reasoning over the input. This task requires
numerical reasoning, an understanding of structured data and financial concepts, and
a model needs to relate follow-up questions to the dialog turns.
For ConvFinQA, we use an entire gold conversation and its context is used as input
to the models. As each “turn” of the conversation concludes, the “turn” along with
the answer for that turn is appended as context for future turns. We report the exact
match accuracy on the public development set.
BloombergGPT performs best of all models for four of the five tasks (ConvFinQA,
FiQA SA, FPB, and Headline) and comes in second in NER (Table 8). Consequently,
BloombergGPT also has the highest win rate among all the models that we tested. The
gap to equally-sized models is especially pronounced for ConvFinQA which is challenging
due to the requirement to use conversational input to reason over tables and generate an
answer.

Table 9: An overview of the Bloomberg-internal sentiment analysis tasks. Input token and
label distribution numbers are computed on the test set.
## 5.3.2 Internal Task: Sentiment Analysis
For the Bloomberg-internal tasks, we consider aspect-specific sentiment analysis, which is
prevalent in financial literature. All of the datasets we use are in English.
Our annotation process consists of a discovery phase during which we establish the an-
notation and sampling procedures, understand how many annotators are typically required
per example, and determine the level of training that is needed for the annotators (Tseng
et al., 2020). Depending on the complexity of the task, our annotators are a dedicated team
of financial experts at Bloomberg, consultant workers, or a combination of both. In each
case, ties are resolved by adjudication from additional annotators and ambiguous examples
are excluded. All the datasets in this section were annotated by 2 annotators with a third
annotator breaking any ties.
We measure the performance of LLMs for the internal datasets using a five-shot evalu-
ation, similar to the external datasets. As the datasets are large, we randomly sample at
most 1k test examples. We report F1 weighted by the support of each label. Note that,
similar to the external datasets, it is likely that the unlabeled versions of the data used in
our internal datasets occur in FinPile and are therefore seen by BloombergGPT during
training. However, since some of FinPile is also available on the web, other LLMs we
compare against may have also been trained on unlabeled versions of this data. Dataset
statistics are provided in Table 9.
• Equity News Sentiment: This task is to predict the aspect-specific sentiment ex-
pressed in the news story toward a company. The dataset consists of English news
stories from Bloomberg, premium, and web content. Annotations of “positive”, “neg-
ative”, or “neutral” indicate that the news story is likely to increase, decrease, or not
change the long-term investor confidence in the company.
• Equity Social Media Sentiment: The task is similar to “Equity News Sentiment”
but instead of news, we use financially-relevant English social media content.
• Equity Transcript Sentiment: This task is also similar to “Equity News Senti-
ment” but instead of news, we use transcripts from company press conferences. The
transcripts are made available through the use of speech recognition and at times,
human edits. Long transcripts are processed in chunks, and each chunk in our dataset
typically contains between 70 and 80 tokens.

• ES News Sentiment: While this task is to predict the aspect-specific sentiment
expressed in the news story towards a company (aspect), the goal is not to indicate
effect on investor confidence. The stories are annotated “positive”, “negative”, or
“neutral” if the news story contains content that reflects good, bad, or neutral news
about the company’s environmental and social policies.
• Country News Sentiment: This task is different from the other sentiment tasks
in that the goal is to predict the sentiment expressed in the news story towards a
country. The dataset consists of English news stories from Bloomberg, premium, and
web content. The stories are annotated “positive”, “negative”, or “neutral” if the
news story alludes to the growth, shrinkage, or status quo of that country’s economy.

performs better than all the other tested models, by a wide margin. The only task in which
the models perform similarly is the social media sentiment task, while BloombergGPT
outperforms the other models by at least 25 and up to over 60 points in the other three.
## 5.3.3 Exploratory Task: NER
Even though NER is a well-established NLP task with state-of-the-art results using BERT
(Wu and Dredze, 2019; Luoma and Pyysalo, 2020) and T5 (Liu et al., 2022) style models,

NER is largely an unexplored task for generative LLMs. NER is not in HELM (Liang et al.,
2022), there is a single (Polish) task in BIG-bench (Srivastava et al., 2022), and none of the
LLMpaperswestudyreportNERperformance. Hence, weconsiderNERasanexploratory
task and report preliminary NER results given its importance in the Financial sector.
There are a few reasons for why NER may be a difficult task for generative LLMs.
NER is an information extraction task, and a better fit for encoder-decoder or encoder-only
architectures. The generative nature of LLMs does not confer an advantage for NER. We
findthatextensive promptengineeringandagreaternumberofshotsarerequired toobtain
reasonable results for NER than for other tasks. Finance-specific NER has subtleties that
make it especially difficult for zero or few-shot learning.
For example, consider the (fabricated) headline “Bloomberg: Mr. Musk adds new fea-
tures to Twitter and comments on China”. Depending on our annotation guidelines and
downstream task needs: (a) the reporting news organization “Bloomberg” can be tagged or
not, depending on whether we want only salient entities, (b) “Mr. Musk” or just “Musk”
is the PER to be tagged, (c) “Twitter” can be tagged as an ORG or a PRD (product)
as features are added to the Twitter product and not the organization, and (d) “China”
can be tagged ORG or LOC, though the right tag is likely ORG. Without adding extensive
annotationguidelinesintheprompt,theLLMdoesnotknowtheintendedtaggingbehavior.
Based on preliminary testing, we determined the following setting to obtain the best
performance on the internal NER tasks from all models. First, we restrict the entity types
to be predicted to be ORG, PER, and LOC. In all, we filtered out less than 1% of entities.
We also remove all documents that contain no entities (i.e., all “O”’s). Both of these modi-
ficationsareintendedtoincreasetheusefulnessoftheexamplesseeninfew-shotprompting.
We expect that further work on prompt engineering for NER could produce better results.
We consider seven Bloomberg internal NER datasets from different domains.
• BN NER: This is a named entity recognition task on entities occurring in English
long-form Bloomberg news content (the “BN wire”) between 2017 to 2020.
• BFW NER: Similar to “BN NER” but instead of using the long-form BN wire, we
use short-form stories from the “Bloomberg First Word” wire between 2018 to 2020.
• Filings NER: The goal of this task is to identify entities that occur in mandatory
financial disclosures filed by companies. The dataset contains filings sampled between
## 2016 and 2019.
• Headlines NER: The goal of this task is to identify entities that occur in headlines
of English Bloomberg news content. The dataset contains headlines sampled between
## 2016 and 2020.
• Premium NER: The goal of this task is to identify entities that occur in a subset
of the third-party English news content ingested by Bloomberg. The dataset contains
stories sampled between 2019 and 2021.
• TranscriptsNER:Thegoalofthistaskistoidentifyentitiesthatoccurintranscripts
of company press conferences. The dataset contains transcripts from 2019.

amples from each filtered internal dataset. We utilize 20-shot prompts and evaluate using
F1. The results from the internal NER tasks are mixed (Table 12). The much larger

Exploratory Task: NER+NED Named entity disambiguation (NED) links entity
mentions to known entities in knowledge bases or other structured information sources.
Within the financial world, we seek to link text mentions of companies to their ticker sym-
bols, an abbreviation that uniquely identifies publicly traded shares of a particular stock
on a particular stock market.
We directly test the ability of an LLM to complete this task by evaluating a joint
NER+NED task: identify the stock tickers of companies mentioned in a document. This

requires the model to first identify company mentions and then generate the corresponding
stock ticker. For example, given “AAPL announced that they will stop using Intel chips
in future products.” the correct NER output would be “AAPL, Intel” while the correct
NER+NED output would be “AAPL, INTC”.
One of the advantages of this task is that it is robust to variations in extracting the
exact text span. While NER evaluation requires exact matches, tickers may be successfully
produced without first identifying spans. Furthermore, it evaluates a model’s knowledge of
companies, their various surface forms, and company to ticker mappings.
We create evaluation data with linked tickers for this task by running a state-of-the-
art entity linking system for companies in financial data over the Bloomberg internal NER
annotateddocumentsfromeachdomain. Weremovedocumentswithnolinkedtickers. Fol-
lowing our NER evaluations, we randomly sample 4,000 training and 500 testing examples
from each filtered internal dataset. We utilize 20-shot prompts and evaluate using F1.

except on social media data where it comes in second behind BLOOM . In our social

## 5.4 BIG-bench Hard
WenowturntoevaluateBloombergGPTonstandard,general-purposeNLPtasks. While
the focus of our model is on financial tasks, our inclusion of general-purpose training data
may help improve not only the financial tasks, but also allow our model to perform well
on more standard NLP datasets. We start with BIG-bench Hard (Suzgun et al., 2022), a
subset of the most challenging tasks in BIG-bench (Srivastava et al., 2022). It only includes
tasksinwhichthebestavailablemodelatconstructionwasunabletoachieveaperformance
higher than the average human rater via standard prompting techniques.
Results for each task are shown in Table 13. Overall, while BloombergGPT falls
behind the much larger PaLM (10x parameters) and BLOOM (3.5x parameters),
540B 176B
it is the best-performing among similarly sized models. In fact, its performance is closer to
BLOOM than it is to either GPT-NeoX or OPT . It further achieves the best perfor-
176B 66B
manceofallmodelsindateunderstanding,hyperbaton(orderingofadjectives),andtracking
shuffled objects. In sum, according to this benchmark, we find that developing finance-
specific BloombergGPT did not come at the expense of its general-purpose abilities.
## 5.5 Knowledge Assessments
We next assess knowledge, which we define as the ability to recall information seen during
model training, via scenarios that have the model answer questions without providing addi-
tional context or resources (closed-book question answering). This includes multiple-choice
questions, and we report accuracy. We follow the template of Brown et al. (2020). The list
of scenarios is as follows:

which include finance and accounting-related questions.
## 5.6 Reading Comprehension
We define reading comprehension benchmarks as tasks in which the model can generate the
correct response based on information contained in the presented input text. Our grouping
includes open-book QA tasks, as opposed to Brown et al. (2020), who separate them into
a different categories. We follow the template of Brown et al. (2020), and report accuracy.
We include the following tasks:
• BoolQ (Clark et al., 2019): Yes/No questions about a passage from Wikipedia.
• OpenBookQA (Mihaylov et al., 2018): Multiple-choice elementary-level science
questions, given a book of science facts, applied to new situations.
• RACE(Laietal.,2017): AmultiplechoicedatasetofmiddleandhighschoolEnglish

## 5.7 Linguistic Tasks
We define as linguistic tasks those scenarios that are not directly connected to user-facing
applications. These include tasks that evaluate disambiguation, grammar, or entailment.
These tasks are designed to directly assess a model’s ability to understand language. We
follow the template of Brown et al. (2020), and report accuracy. The list of tasks is as
follows:
• Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE, Dagan et al., 2007; Haim et al., 2006;
Giampiccolo et al., 2007; Bentivogli et al., 2009): Given two text fragments, identify
whether the meaning of one text is entailed.
• Adversarial NLI (ANLI, Nie et al., 2020): Adversarially constructed entailment
detection.
• CommitmentBank (CB, De Marneffe et al., 2019): Naturally occurring discourses
whose final sentence contains a clause-embedding predicate.
• Choice of Plausible Alternatives (COPA, Gordon et al., 2011): Premise and two
alternatives,wherethetaskistoselectthealternativethatmoreplausiblyhasacausal
relation with the premise.
• Words in Context (WIC Pilehvar and Camacho-Collados, 2019): Determine if a
word is being used with the same meaning in two sentences.

## 5.8 Summary
Across dozens of tasks in many benchmarks a clear picture emerges. Among the models
with tens of billions of parameters that we compare to, BloombergGPT performs the
best. Furthermore, in some cases, it is competitive or exceeds the performance of much
larger models (hundreds of billions of parameters). While our goal for BloombergGPT

purpose data that exceed similarly sized models, and in some cases match or outperform
much larger models.

## 7 Related Work
Language Models. Language modeling has a long history in the NLP community. The
idea of training a probabilistic language model for scoring word sequences was likely first
introduced by Jelinek (1976). N-gram models were popular for decades (Brown et al.,
1992), and were trained on corpora up to 2 trillion tokens (Brants et al., 2007). Research
on training language models accelerated over the last decade due to innovations in machine
learning, data availability, and compute. Early work in autoregressive language modeling
(e.g., Mikolov et al., 2010; Sutskever et al., 2011) used recurrent neural networks, but
these were small models trained on small datasets. The introduction of the transformer
architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) facilitated the scaling of these models in terms of data,
compute, and the number of parameters.
The process of developing models that could better approximate the distribution of
language over large corpora led to the discovery that the representations these models
produce are useful starting points for many downstream tasks. This was demonstrated by

with an autoregressive language modeling objective achieves strong performance in transfer
learning. Radford et al. (2019) further showed scaling the model size and training data led
to autoregressive language models that perform well in different downstream tasks without
any additional supervised fine-tuning.
Brown et al. (2020) showed that further scaling the models led to the emergence of new
model capabilities and increased model robustness. Since the release of GPT-3 by Brown
et al. (2020), many other researchers built large language models to study data quantity,
data quality, network architecture, parameter scaling, data scaling, tokenization, and open-
sourcing strategies (Raffel et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022a; Black et al., 2022; Rae et al.,
2021; Hoffmann et al., 2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Lieber et al., 2021; Zeng et al., 2022;
Tafjord and Clark, 2021; Smith et al., 2022; Scao et al., 2022; Taylor et al., 2022; Lin et al.,

2022; Soltan et al., 2022; Thoppilan et al., 2022; Bao et al., 2022; Sanh et al., 2022; Roller
et al., 2021; Glaese et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2021; Peng et al., 2022, among many others).
Domain-Specific Large Language Models. The value of domain-specific training for
masked(encoderonly)languagemodelsiswellestablished. Commonlyacceptedapproaches
are to train BERT models (Devlin et al., 2019) from scratch on domain-specific data or to
continue pretraining an existing model on new domain-specific data (Gururangan et al.,
2020). Following these strategies, BioBERT (Lee et al., 2020) adapts BERT to the biomed-
ical domain and SciBERT is trained on scientific publications (Beltagy et al., 2019). The
results of these papers showed that in-domain training allows models to outperform previ-
ous state-of-the-art models in a variety of biomedical text mining tasks. Further examples
of this paradigm are ClinicalBERT for the clinical domain (Huang et al., 2019), BioMed-
RoBERTa for scientific biomedical papers (Gururangan et al., 2020), and BERTweet and
Bernice for Twitter data (Nguyen et al., 2020; DeLucia et al., 2022).
Since the training of auto-regressive—decoder-only—language models of more than 10B
parameters is significantly more costly than training masked LMs under 1B parameters,
there have been much fewer examples of domain-specific autoregressive models. However,
existing approaches follow the same two strategies. Adapting an existing model, medPaLM
(Singhal et al., 2022) adapted PaLM to the biomedical domain and Minerva (Lewkowycz
et al., 2022) to mathematical reasoning tasks.
Recently, several examples of from-scratch trained decoder-only models for domain-
specific data have emerged. One popular domain is protein sequences since they can be
represented using language-like sequences but are not covered by natural language mod-
els (e.g., Lin et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2021; Nijkamp et al., 2022). However, there can be
benefits even for models in natural language domains. Galactica is trained exclusively on
a large collection of scientific datasets, and includes special processing to handle scientific
notations (Taylor et al., 2022). While performing very well on scientific tasks, Galactica
also surprisingly also performs well on more standard NLP tasks. BioGPT (Luo et al.,
2022) and BioMedLM (Bolton et al., 2023) are both smaller GPT-style models trained on
biomedicaldata. Lehmanetal.(2023)comparesencoder/decodermodelstrainedexclusively
on domain-specific data, versus those adapted from general-purpose training. Researchers
working on large generative language dialog models have reached similar conclusions about
the benefits of using domain-specific training data (Zhang et al., 2020; Roller et al., 2021;
Thoppilan et al., 2022).
These findings highlight the advantages of in-domain pretraining, especially if sufficient
data is available, as it is in our case. Inspired by the general capabilities of Galactica, we
augment our private data with public data with the goal of investigating whether a model
can gain in-domain capabilities without sacrificing general-domain performance.
Training Data. Large corpora of raw text data are critical for training LLMs. As a
result, there are now several corpora available that cover a wide range of sources.
TheColossalCleanCrawledCorpus(C4,Raffeletal.,2020)drawsfromCommonCrawl
to create a processed training corpus. The Pile is a carefully curated corpus that contains
a wide range of data sources (Gao et al., 2021). These datasets are built on or include
web crawls (OpenWebText2) augmented with an array of data from high-quality sources
(Pubmed, Arxiv). Various efforts aim to clean datasets, especially web data, by removing

unwanted or harmful text (Touvron et al., 2023; Rae et al., 2020). BLOOM (Scao et al.,
2022) carefully selected data sources and included various filtering mechanisms (Jernite
et al., 2022).
While web data is an effective strategy for obtaining large amounts of diverse data,
robust cleaning efforts still result in data artifacts, duplicates (Carlini et al., 2020), various
types of toxic language (Welbl et al., 2021), and it can lead to unintended marginalization
of minority voices (Xu et al., 2021). Dodge et al. (2021) studied C4 to better understand
the metadata, and the included and excluded data. Their findings suggest that C4 contains
machine-generatedtext, isbiasedduetoexclusionfiltersandmightcontainexamplesdrawn
from evaluation datasets for NLP tasks. A similar effort was undertaken by Zeng et al.

model.
Lee et al. (2022a) investigated the impact of deduplication on model performance for
several datasets and found that deduplication reduces the emission of memorized training
data, allows better estimation of the generalization error, and improves training time and
costwithoutimpactingperformance. Theseinsightshighlighttheimportanceandchallenges
ofconstructinghigh-qualitytrainingcorpora. Asdiscussedin§2, Bloomberg’scorebusiness
curates and provides access to datasets, which we use to construct a high-quality dataset
FinPile to train BloombergGPT, resulting in best-in-class financial performance.
Evaluation. The tasks addressed by language models have vastly increased and require a
verydifferentevaluationprocessfromtraditionaltask-specificsystems. Therehavebeentwo
paradigms for LLM evaluation: The first is to evaluate a model in many different scenarios
via automatic evaluation (Liang et al., 2022; Srivastava et al., 2022) and the second is to
performextrinsicandtask-specificevaluationsbyintegratingthemintouserworkflows(e.g.,
Lee et al., 2022b; Goyal et al., 2022).
While the second strategy is necessary for assessing deployments of models in products,
it is infeasible to run these human evaluations at a scale of the first strategy and it is thus
standard to follow the first strategy when introducing new models. In our case, we combine
multiple general-purpose evaluations from multiple existing benchmarks that have different
goals. Srivastava et al. (2022) aim for maximum coverage by soliciting tasks from the
entire research community, while HELM (Liang et al., 2022) suggests evaluation in various
“scenarios” that are represented through specific datasets. Earlier language model papers
developed their own evaluation schemata (Brown et al., 2020). While these benchmarks
allow for a side-by-side comparison between models, it is challenging to ensure that all
experimental parameters (prompts, decoding strategies, few-shot examples, etc.) are the
same. For that reason, we differentiate between reported and verified numbers in our
evaluation (§5).
Beyond the general-purpose evaluation, we also require a targeted domain evaluation.
Prior domain-specific models like Galactica (Taylor et al., 2022) chose a set of tasks that
the model is likely to perform well on. In their case, these were various scientific tasks.
However, there exists no standard benchmark for the financial NLP domain. While the
recent work on FLUE (Shah et al., 2022) aims to provide such a benchmark, it has limited
coverage of relevant tasks, no suggested evaluation strategy for few-shot learning, and the
quality of some annotations is low. To provide externally comparable results, we developed

afew-shotstrategyforFLUE,butalsodecidedtoaugmentthepubliclyavailableevaluation
tasks with company-internal benchmarks.
Model Size. Large language model training remains expensive in terms of the compu-
tational cost and human effort to assemble data and train the model. Determining the
optimal amount of training data and model shape and size for the best utilization of re-
sources becomes important.
Kaplan et al. (2020) first studied the dependence of language model performance on
architecture, parameter size, compute power, and dataset size. They reported that the
number of model parameters, the dataset size, and the amount of compute improves perfor-
mance on the autoregressive language modeling objective smoothly according to the power
law. A similar investigation by Hernandez et al. (2021) into data transfer for differing dis-
tributions found that this also follows a power law. Moving beyond studying the effect on
loss, Rae et al. (2021) analyzed the effect of scale on undesirable properties such as bias
and toxicity by training a wide range of model sizes.
Comparing model architectures, Levine et al. (2020) studied the scaling of models that
use self-attention and derived guidelines for depth-to-width allocation. Tay et al. (2021)
reported that model shape (depth-width ratio) impacted performance on downstream tasks
even if it had minimal impact on the pretraining objective. Tay et al. (2022a) further
studied the effect of scaling for different model architectures and showed that architecture
choice is pertinent when scaling and that the vanilla transformer architecture scales best.
Of particular importance to this work is the study of Hoffmann et al. (2022), who inves-
tigated the effect of model size and the number of training tokens on the performance of a
modelgivenafixedcomputebudget. Theypositedthatexistinglargelanguagemodelswere
undertrainedandthatmodelsizeandthenumberoftrainingtokensshouldbescaledequally.
They demonstrated this hypothesis through Chinchilla, a model significantly smaller, yet
higher performing, than most of the largest LLMs. These findings opened the door for
“Chinchilla optimal” training of smaller models that achieve strong performance, and for
which inference can be run much more efficiently than for their larger counterparts. These
findings led us to consider a nearly Chinchilla-optimal model using a standard architecture.
Tokenization. Tokenization and vocabulary choice play a critical role in model perfor-
manceastheycanhelpthemodellearnmeaningfulrepresentationsandgeneralizetounseen
words. Byte-Pair encoding (BPE) (Sennrich et al., 2016) learns a greedy bottom-up vo-
cabulary by repeatedly merging the most frequent sequence pairs in the training set till a
predetermined vocabulary size is reached. Radford et al. (2018) adapted BPE by limiting
thebasevocabularytobeallpossiblebytesasopposedtoallUnicodecharacters. Wordpiece
tokenization (Schuster and Nakajima, 2012) also learns a greedy bottom-up vocabulary by
repeatedly merging the sequence-pair that maximizes the likelihood of the training data,
which is a slight deviation from the method in Sennrich et al. (2016).
In contrast to BPE and Wordpiece, the Unigram tokenizer (Kudo, 2018) learns a top-
down vocabulary by first initializing a large vocabulary and repeatedly discarding those
vocabulary items that increase loss (e.g., log-likelihood of the training data) the least. By
construction, the Unigram model can tokenize an input text in several different ways. That
is,theUnigrammodelsavesprobabilitiesallowingforsmartertokenizationatinferencetime.

Finally, SentencePiece (Kudo and Richardson, 2018) adapts the schemes mentioned
above to handle languages that are not space separated. Beltagy et al. (2019) constructed a
vocabulary specific to scientific text and observed that their domain-specific trained vocab-
ulary only had a 42% overlap with the non-domain-specific BERT vocabulary trained on
general domain text. Similarly, Lewis et al. (2020) showed that a dedicated biomedical vo-
cabulary improved performance on sequence labeling tasks consistently. Lieber et al. (2021)
constructed a larger vocabulary to ensure token efficiency, which the authors claim resulted
in reduced training time and better semantic representation. These findings demonstrate
theimportanceofselectingatokenizerandaccompanyingvocabularythatbestreflectsthat
training domain. For those reasons, we decided to train our own unigram tokenizer instead
of relying on existing public ones.
Positional Embeddings. Transformer-based models rely on positional embeddings to
encode position and location information of words in a text. Encoding the sequence posi-
tionandtheeffectofthischoiceonmodelperformancehavebeenstudiedextensively. These
include sinusoidal embeddings (Vaswani et al., 2017), rotary position embeddings (Su et al.,
2021a), adding relative position bias (Raffel et al., 2020), and adding linear biases to atten-
tion heads (Press et al., 2022). A side-effect of the strategy in Press et al. (2022) is that one
can train on shorter sequences without loss in performance on longer sequences. This has
two benefits: first, models learn to generalize (extrapolate) to longer sequences and second,
models can be trained on shorter sequences reducing training time.
## 8 Ethics, Limitations, and Implications
The rapid development and adoption of large language models have been accompanied by
a rigorous conversation about the ethics, uses, and limitations of these models. For a more
completetreatmentofthesetopics, wedirectthereadertoBommasanietal.(2021);Bender
et al. (2021); Birhane et al. (2022); Weidinger et al. (2021, 2022). We discuss issues that
are directly relevant to the development of BloombergGPT.
## 8.1 Ethical Use
Finance is a sensitive area for technology, and ensuring accurate, factual information is
crucial for our products, our clients, and the firm’s reputation in the marketplace. On
the other hand, our clients are also eager to adopt state-of-the-art technology to support
their workflows. To provide natural language applications to the financial community, we
have developed a rigorous risk and testing assessment process. This process includes careful
annotationguidelines(Tsengetal.,2020),pre-launchreviewatmultiplelevelsbythecentral
risk and compliance organizations, and by the product leaders (e.g., the newsroom) as
applicable, and post-launch monitoring. Moreover, we conduct our research, development,
and deployment of NLP and AI systems in accordance with all applicable regulations.

## 8.2 Openness
AnongoingdebateinthecommunityconcernshowLLMsshouldbereleased,ifatall. While

ing models can lead to nefarious purposes. Especially for a model like BloombergGPT,
whichistrainedonasignificantamountofpressreleases, newsarticles, andfilings, arelease
carries a high risk for abuse through imitation.
Wehavewitnessedmanydifferentstrategiestomitigaterisksassociatedwiththerelease
of LLMs. One strategy is to freely and openly share trained models (Scao et al., 2022), and
rely on a license that dictates how the model should and should not be used. Another
requires individuals to apply for access to the trained model parameters (Zhang et al.,
2022a; Touvron et al., 2023). A more restrictive approach is to provide API access to
models, but no access to the underlying model parameters or detailed information on the
data the model was trained on (Brown et al., 2020). Finally, some have provided no access
to the model (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Hoffmann et al., 2022). Each decision reflects a
combination of factors, including model use, potential harms, and business decisions.
One of Bloomberg’s core business propositions is around providing access to data that
has been collected over the course of decades. As is well known, LLMs are susceptible to
data leakage attacks and it is possible to extract significant segments of text given model
weights (Carlini et al., 2020, 2022). Moreover, even giving selective access to researchers
isn’t a guarantee that the model cannot be leaked. Without strong privacy guarantees, we
must be concerned that providing access to model weights entails giving access to FinPile.
Forthisreason,weerronthesideofcautionandfollowthepracticeofotherLLMdevelopers
in not releasing our model.
Nevertheless, our insights and experiences in training and evaluating BloombergGPT
contribute to the developing understanding of these models. In particular, our experience
may be useful to those building domain-specific models. During the process of developing
BloombergGPT, we found the OPT chronicles, experiences of the BLOOM team, as
well as work of non-open models like GPT-3, PaLM, Chinchilla, and Gopher, to be crucial
enablers of our work. In support of this tradition, we include our Training Chronicles
(Appendix C).
## 9 Conclusion
We have presented BloombergGPT, a best-in-class LLM for financial NLP.
Our model contributes to the ongoing dialog on effective ways to train domain-specific
models. Ourtrainingstrategyofmixingdomain-specificandgeneral-purposedataresultsin
a model that balances performance in both domains. Additionally, our work offers another
data point on selecting Chinchilla optimal-sized models. Finally, we hope that our model
training logs will provide a guide for those training their own LLMs.
We have several interesting directions to pursue. First, task fine-tuning has yielded
significant improvements in LLMs, and we plan to consider what unique opportunities exist

for model alignment in the financial domain (Wei et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2022). Second,
by training on data in FinPile, we are selecting data that may exhibit less toxic and biased
language. The effects of this on the final model are unknown as yet, which we plan to test.
Third, we seek to understand how our tokenization strategy changes the resulting model.
These are a few of the new research directions we hope to pursue with BloombergGPT.
WeachievestrongresultsongeneralLLMbenchmarksandoutperformcomparablemod-
els on financial tasks. We attribute this, in decreasing order of impact, to 1. a well-curated
internal dataset, 2. our unique choice in tokenizer, and 3. an up-to-date architecture. We
will continue to develop financial applications with BloombergGPT to further explore
the benefits of these modeling choices.

Appendix A. Architecture
A.0 Notation
Styling. Unstyled variables denote scalars, bold lower-case variables represent [column]
vectors, and bold capitalized variables represent matrices. For instance, h could be an
i,j
element in the vector h , which could in turn be the j-th column of matrix H.
j
Named functions are typed in non-italicized regular typeface, such as softmax(·) and
FFN(·).
Red color is used to denote trainable parameters, or functions that are parametrized by
trainable parameters, such as W or FFN(·).
Sequences. A sequence (x ,...,x ) of n elements is denoted by {x }n . We treat a
## 1 n i i=1
sequence of (column) vectors as a matrix, i.e. X = {x }n ∈ Rm×n, where each x ∈ Rm.
i i=1 i
Operators.
• f : Rn → Rn: A function on vectors, that is, y = f(x) where x,y ∈ Rn are n-
dimensional real valued vectors. Whenever such a function is applied to a matrix, it
is applied column-wise: f(X) = {f(x )}m , X ∈ Rn×m.
j j=1
• A⊙B: Element-wise (or Hadamard) product of matrices or vectors A and B (of the
same shape).
• 1(P): Indicator function that returns 1 if the predicate P is true and 0 otherwise.
• [n]: For integer n, the set of all positive integers up to (including) n, i.e. {1,...,n}.
• A+b: Adding a vector to a matrix is defined as repeated addition to each column.
That is, A+b = {a +b}n .
i i=1
exp(x)
• Softmax: softmax(x) = where exp(·) is applied element-wise to a vector.
(cid:80)nexp(x
)
i i
• Dropout: dropp(x) = ·m⊙x where, m = [m ]n ⊤, and m ∼ Bernoulli(1−p).
1−p i i=1 i
Random variables m are drawn independently for each presentation of an example.
i
A.1 Full Architecture
Embedding. Let (x ,...,x ) = {x }T ∈ VT denote an input sequence of length T,
## 1 t t t=1
whereeachelementx denotesanintegeridentifierofatokenfromthevocabularyV = [|V|].
t
Initial input representations H0 = {h0}T are obtained by
t t=1
h¯0 = Weme ∀t (1)
t xt
h0 = LNem(h¯0) ∀t (2)
t t
whereWem ∈ RD×|V| isthetokenembeddingmatrix, e ∈ R|V| isthex -thstandardbasis
xt t
vector, and LNem is the embedding LayerNorm function, to be defined in the following
subsections.
Observe that no positional embedding is applied here due to how ALiBi works.

Layers. Layer representations Hℓ ∈ RD×T for each layer ℓ = 1,...,L can be sequentially
defined as follows (this computation is sometimes referred to as a “block”):
H¯ℓ = Hℓ−1+SA (LNin(Hℓ−1)) ∀ℓ (3)
ℓ ℓ
Hℓ = H¯ℓ+FFN (LNat(H¯ℓ)) ∀ℓ (4)
ℓ ℓ
where SA , FFN , and LN• denote SelfAttention, FeedForwardNetwork, and LayerNorm
ℓ ℓ ℓ
functions at layer ℓ, respectively, as defined in the following subsections. The red color
indicates that the functions depend on trainable parameters. LN• is further parametrized
ℓ
by an indication of what the function is applied to, such as LNin when applied to the block
ℓ
input and LNat when applied to the attention output. We designate these separately since
ℓ
they use different (i.e. untied) trainable parameters.
Logits. Given the final layer representation HL, logits Y ∈ R|V|×T are obtained as:
Y = Wem⊤LNf(HL) (5)
where Wem ∈ RD×|V| is the same embedding matrix we used in the embedding part and
LNf is the final LayerNorm application. We follow the PaLM approach in omitting a bias
term.
The token distribution for position j+1, conditioned on the prefix (x ,...,x ), is given
## 1 j
by
P(x = w|{x }j ) = softmax(y ) (6)
j+1 t t=1 j w
where y is the j’th column of Y.
j
A.2 SelfAttention with ALiBi (SA)
SelfAttention with ALiBi at layer ℓ, SA : RD×T → RD×T is defined as follows.
ℓ
Let n ∈ {1,...,N} denote an attention head where N is the total number of heads. Let
Dn denote the dimensionality of each head. Let An,M ∈ RT×T denote the ALiBi matrix
and the attention mask, respectively, which will be defined later.
Then, Y = SA (X) such that:
ℓ
Qn = W n,q X +b n,q ∀n (7)
ℓ ℓ
Kn = W n,k X +b n,k ∀n (8)

b n,q ,b n,k ,b n,v ∈ RDn, ∀n, c ∈ RD, are the trainable bias parameters, and p ,p ∈ [0,1)
ℓ ℓ ℓ ℓ at h
are the attention and hidden unit dropout probabilities.
The ALiBi matrix An = [an ] ∈ RT×T is constructed as:
i,j i,j
N˜ = 2⌊log 2 (N)⌋ (14)
(cid:22) (cid:23)
n−1
n˜ = 1+((n−1)modN˜)−0.5 (15)
N˜
an i,j = 2− N 8n˜ ·(i−j)·1(i < j) ∀i,j ∈ [T],n ∈ [N] (16)
and the attention mask M = [mn ] ∈ RT×T is constructed as:
i,j i,j
m = 1(i ≤ j)−∞·1(i > j) ∀i,j ∈ [T] (17)
i,j
where we follow the convention that ∞·0 = 0.
A.3 LayerNorm (LN)
LayerNorm, LNθ : RD → RD, is defined as follows:
x−µ(x)
y = LNθ(x) = ⊙γθ +βθ (18)
(cid:112)
σ2(x)+ϵ
where

and, γθ,βθ ∈ RD are the trainable gain and bias parameters, and ϵ ∈ R is a small constant.
θ is used as the parametrization variable to emphasize LNem, LNf, and LNin, LNat, ∀ℓ
ℓ ℓ
have different (untied) γ and β parameters.
A.4 FeedForwardNetwork (FFN)
Feedforward network component FFN : RD → RD is defined as a simple multilayer per-
ℓ
ceptron. y = FFN (x) such that:

Appendix B. Details on external financial tasks
FPB (Malo et al., 2014): The Financial Phrasebank Dataset includes a sentiment classi-
~
fication task on 5,000 sentences in the English language taken from financial news about
companies listed on OMX Helsinki. Sentiment annotations of positive, negative, neutral
are adjudicated from the perspective of an investor: any news that could benefit/hurt an
investor is considered positive/negative and neutral otherwise. Each sentence is annotated
by 5 to 8 annotators who have sufficient knowledge of finance, whereas the source sentences
were written by financial journalists. For example, news about shrinking revenue would be
labeled negative and company growth as positive. While there are different configurations
of this dataset with each configuration denoting the percentage agreement between anno-
tators (≥50%, ≥66%, ≥75%, 100%), we choose to use the configuration with ≥50%. Since
an official train-test split is not available, we create our own random split. Our training
split contains 3,876 sentences with 1,086 positive, 488 negative, and 2,302 neutral sentences
and our test set contains 970 sentences with 277 positive, 116 negative, and 577 neutral
sentences. We choose 5 shots and report F1 score weighted by support.

with FPB, we create our own random split combining both microblogs and news. After
discretization, our training set contains 938 sentences with 576 positive, 287 negative, and
## 75 neutral sentences and our test set contains 235 sentences with 141 positive, 76 negative,
and 18 neutral sentences. We select 5 shots and report weighted F1.
Headline (Sinha and Khandait, 2020): This is a binary classification task of whether a
news headline in the gold commodity domain includes certain information. This human-

scraped from providers such as Reuters, The Hindu, The Economic Times, Bloomberg, and

from aggregator sites such as Kitco, and MetalsDaily. Each news article carries a subset of
the following tags: “price or not”, “price up”, “price down”, “price stable”, “past price”,
“future price”, “past general”, “future general”, “asset comparison”. The dataset is created
using annotator consensus and Cohen’s Kappa for each of the categories is ≥0.85 indicating
a high-quality dataset. Like with FPB, we create our own random split. Our training set
contains 9,129 sentences with 7,780, 3,785, 3,392, 414, 7,482, 299, 1,285, 67, 1,696 examples
of “price or not”, “price up”, “price down”, “price stable”, “past price”, “future price”,
“past general”, “future general”, “asset comparison” classes, respectively. Similarly, the
test set contains 2283 sentences with 1,955, 962, 838, 109, 1,873, 82, 313, 15, 454 examples
of the same classes. We verbalize each tag into a question using the official documentation
on each tag as shown in Table 18. We used 5 shots, and report the average weighted F1
score across all categories.

data gathered for credit risk assessment. The dataset consists of 8 documents with 55,000
words of financial agreements filed with the SEC. The annotated entity types follow the
standard CoNLL format (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003) and are annotated with
PER, LOC, ORG, and MISC. We use Fin-5 as the training data for context sampling and
test on the Fin-3 split. As MISC cannot be defined on its own but “names (that) are
not already in the other categories” (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003), we drop all
entities with type MISC. Additionally, as it is nontrivial to learn to predict empty output in
the few-shot set-up, we drop sentences that do not contain any entity. After preprocessing,
our training set contains 504 sentences with 168 PER, 745 LOC, and 241 ORG, and our
test set consists of 98 sentences with 39 PER, 216 LOC, and 56 ORG. We found that all
the models required more shots to perform well. Hence, we selected 20 shots and report the
entity-level F1 score.
ConvFinQA (Chenetal.,2022): Givenaninputthatincludestextandatleastonetable
with financial data, the task is to answer conversational questions that require numerical
reasoning over the input. The source data is earning reports of S&P 500 companies and
consists of 3,892 conversations consisting 14,115 questions. This task requires numerical
reasoning, an understanding of structured data and financial concepts, and a model needs
to relate follow-up questions to the dialog turns. To solve this task, we use “1 shot” where
an entire gold conversation and its context is input to the models. In addition, as each
“turn” of the conversation concludes, the “turn” along with the “gold” answer for that
turn is appended as context for future turns. Tables are linearized in the context (as
suggested by the authors) as Markdown tables, and we replace an empty entry with ”-”.
The reported score is the exact match accuracy of the direct answer produced by a model.
As test set labels are not publicly available, we report results on the dev set instead. Our
training set contains 11,104 conversations and 45,888 questions and our test set contains
1,490 conversations and 5,932 questions.

Appendix C. Training Chronicles
C.0 Still
Our first training run was called v0. In this run, we experimented with curriculum learning.
Data that the model would see in the future would likely be similar to the newer data in
our training corpus, so we wanted the model to do better on those future documents.
Additionally, since there are facts that change over time, newer information should ideally
override the old. Therefore, we temporally ordered the training data by month in FinPile.
Figure 7 shows the learning curve for run v0. We observed a large gap between training
and validation losses, which was expected: early stages of training would observe the oldest
data(startingfrom2007)whereasourvalidationsetwasstrictlyfromthefuture(i.e., 2022).
However, one week into training we found the model stuck on both training and validation
loss, as seen by the very limited validation progress between steps 15k-20k and almost no
progress after step 20k. There was the possibility that the training loss and the divergence
of training and validation loss would both resolve themselves as the training data became
more and more similar to the validation data as the curriculum progressed. However, we
deemed this to be too risky to catch any other potential problems with the training that
might require early intervention, since it would mean training for many steps without any
diagnostic signal. We thus decided to abandon curriculum learning altogether.

We removed curriculum learning by shuffling all of our training data uniformly on the
shard level.3 We then started a new run (v1.0), which led to much faster improvements
in the validation loss. We were unable to ascertain if curriculum learning had a negative
impact on training or if the loss plateaued due to other factors, for example, the other
discovered issue in v1.x.

hypothesized would eventually grow more. Since we didn’t want to waste training time, we

did our best to make decisions early instead of allowing the model to continue down a bad
training path.
We investigated the norms of the weights themselves to see if any peculiar trends were
aligning with the gradient growth. In particular, we were curious to see if there were
particular layers or components that were responsible for the large gradient norms.
Figure 9 plots L2 norms for each component, averaged by the square root of the number
of elements (layer norm multipliers start from 1 and all the others start close to zero due
to initialization). We observed that all components follow a similar benign trend except
one: Input LayerNorm at layer 1 (i.e. LNin), which suddenly elbows and starts increasing
~
roughly linearly after step 12k. This also aligns with the initial growth of the gradient
norms.
To take a closer look, we inspected individual values of the multiplier weights γin (there
are 60 such values in a single model shard out of 128) in Figure 10. We observed all values
contributing to the same trend of shrinking until steps 11-12k and then shifting to move
upward instead.
During this investigation, we discovered another bug: Weight decay was applied to all
the non-bias parameters, as opposed to skipping the LayerNorm multiplier weight γ since
they are initialized at 1. To the best of our knowledge, this practice has been inherited from
the BERT implementation4.

This makes the elbow artifact shown in Figure 10 even more confusing: An additional
push of weights towards 0 would trivially explain a downward trend but not a sudden shift
to growth.
After four failed attempts to fix the run, we considered the possibility of this run being
unsalvageable and contemplated starting from scratch to apply a more conservative hyper-
parameter setting from the beginning. These would include things that we have tried in
our attempts such as shrinking the learning rate or gradient clipping. Additionally, because
the pathological trend change is isolated to LNin, which is topologically very close to the
removed LayerNorm at the embedding layer (LNem) we decided to add back LNem as an
additional precaution, despite most other LLMs not having this component.
C.2 Slide
After numerous attempts to fix the elbow issue, we wanted to be as conservative as possible
for the hyperparameter choices when starting from scratch to keep the learning dynamics
as stable as possible. We started the next run (v2.0) with the following hyperparameters
and changes:
• Use FP32 precision in LM-head (softmax in Equation (6))

• Use max learning rate of 6e-5 instead of 1e-4
• Use a gradient clipping value of 0.3 instead of 1.0
• Fully shuffle data
• Use a different seed to ensure different initialization and data order
• Reintroduce LayerNorm at embedding layer (LNem)
• Use a longer learning rate warm-up period of 1800 steps
• Remove incorrect use of weight decay on LayerNorm multipliers (γ•)
•
• Use Megatron initialization rescaling (see use of z′ in Appendix A.5)
• Apply query key layer scaling (Shoeybi et al., 2019)
• Applyabatchsizewarm-up: Useabatchsizeof1024for7200iterations,thenincrease
to 2048
In addition to hyperparameter changes, we also performed additional monitoring to catch
issues earlier. Because we observed the pathological behavior at the first LayerNorm com-
√
ponent, we started monitoring the norms of the weights γem and γin (scaled by 1/ D).
With the aforementioned conservative choice of hyperparameters during v2.0, we ob-
~
servedverysmoothand(thankfully!) uneventfultrainingforapproximately42days( 115,500
iterations). We saw few surprises both in terms of training and validation performance
curves (see Figure 11), as well as the norms of the gradients. The only intervention needed
during this period was to restart the job after 28 days, due to the underlying platform
having a hard limit on the duration of the job.
During this period, we observed a smoothly decreasing validation loss (except a few
jumps earlier on) until it started to flatten around 2.116 (y-axis) at the end. Running
training loss has a similar trend of overall decrease with the typical jitter and random
occasional increments.
We also observed that weight norms for LayerNorm components of the initial layer
were smooth and stable without any immediate or long-term trend changes (see Figure 11).
This presents some evidence that we were not suffering from the pathological behavior we
observed in v1.x in regards to LayerNorm parameters γem.
Overall,whilethissetofchangesledtoasmoothtrainingruninv2.0,wecannotconclude
which of these changes was decisive in leading to a successful training run. We defer such
investigation to future work.
C.3 Suspense
About 48 days into training v2.0, we noticed that the validation loss had not improved in
a week (from iteration 115,500 to 133,200, see Figure 12, v2.0 curves). During the same
period, we also noticed training loss flattening around 2.10 (with the usual jitter). We
suspected that the model was no longer learning properly, and decided to intervene.
We considered two options: 1) changing the max learning rate, 2) rolling back to an ear-

We had two proposed ways in which to change the learning rate. An argument for
increasing the learning rate was the possibility that we were stuck in a local optimum.
Allowing the optimizer to make bigger jumps would allow the model to escape the optimum
and continue learning. On the other hand, the argument for decreasing the learning rate
wasbasedonZhangetal.(2022a)inwhichtheyhadobservedimprovementsaftershrinking
the learning rate after getting stuck. Furthermore, we had spent more steps in the high-
learning-rate region of the overall learning rate schedule since, by following the Chinchilla
scaling law, we had more total steps compared to models like BLOOM or GPT-3.
The other option was to roll back to an earlier checkpoint, re-shuffle the remainder of
the data and continue training. Chowdhery et al. (2022) found that when they saw spikes
in the validation loss, they “re-started training from a checkpoint roughly 100 steps before
the spike started, and skipped roughly 200–500 data batches.” This suggests that data
ordering mattered, and backing out of a bad data/gradient path may help. That may have
been our issue with curriculum learning (v0.x), although it may have been that the issues
were not with curriculum learning but with other issues we fixed in v1.0.
Intheend, wedecidedtoshrink thelearningrate, rollbacktothestartoftheincreasing
validation loss trend 7 days prior, and also re-shuffle the remaining data.
We also became concerned that our choices were based on a single, albeit large, de-
velopment set. Our validation set only contained data from July 2022 (val ; roughly
future
105M tokens), whereas the training set ranged from 2007 to June 2022, meaning that the
validation set was slightly out of distribution. We had done this to ensure a future-forward
evaluation, and to ensure that the training set didn’t have leaked validation data. While
this matched our goals, it was possible that a single month of data was not properly reflec-
tive of the model’s abilities, and thus we were making decisions that overfit the validation

data. We created a second validation set from the last 105M tokens of the training set for
offline evaluation (val ). These tokens were from training but would be unobserved until
past
the model finished training. However, since the model training data was fully shuffled, this
validation set was not from a held-out time-period.

Using our two dev sets and downstream evaluations for guidance, we made several
attempts to improve run v2.0 and direct the model to continue learning. A summary of our
attempts follows:
Run Changes from v2.0 run
Shared Change - Re-shuffle future data starting from step 115500
- Start from v2.0 step 115500
v2.1
- Reduce max learning rate from 6e-5 to 4e-5
- Start from v2.0 step 115500
v2.2
- Increase dropout from 0.0 to 0.1
- Start from v2.1 step 129900
v2.3 - Reduce max learning rate from 6e-5 to 2e-5
- Increase dropout from 0.0 to 0.1
- Start from v2.1 step 129900
v2.4
- Reduce max learning rate from 6e-5 to 2e-5
- Start from v2.3 step 137100
v2.5 - Reduce max learning rate from 6e-5 to 1e-5
- Increase dropout from 0.0 to 0.1
- Start from v2.1 step 129900
v2.6 - Reduce max learning rate from 6e-5 to 2e-5
- Reduce weight decay from 0.1 to 0.01

After we lowered the learning rate and rolled back the model (v2.1), we observed an
initial sudden (and dramatic) improvement; however, validation loss quickly flattened out.
Coupled with the mixed results on downstream evaluation, we decided to enable dropout
for the first time with a probability of 0.1.
With dropout, as expected, we observed a larger training loss since dropout is applied
duringthecomputationoftheloss(v2.2inFigure12). However,weobservedaninitiallyde-
creasing validation loss. Still, as the run progressed further, validation loss started creeping
back up and met the value of the original run (v2.0, blue).
Based on these observations, we decided that further decreasing the learning rate would
give us the best chance to continue learning successfully. We subsequently tried various
combinations of smaller values of learning rate and adding dropout. Observe that in v2.3
(red) with 2e-5 max learning rate and in v2.5 (brown) with 1e-5 as its continuation, both
with a dropout rate of 0.1, shown in Figure 12. In Table 20, we observed v2.3 led to
much better perplexity and slightly better downstream performance, and v2.5 continues
to improve downstream performance compared to v2.3 in the beginning, while decreasing
perplexity slightly. v2.4 (purple) attempted a max learning rate of 2e-5 as well, without
dropout, however. The only odd run during this time is v2.6 (pink), in which we exper-
imented with a smaller weight decay of 0.01 (compared to the original 0.1) with a max
learning rate of 2e-5 to investigate the possibility of getting stuck in local minima due to
toostrongofapullfromtheweightdecay. However, thisyieldsalmosttheexactsamecurve
as the original 0.1 weight decay (the difference between v2.4 and v2.6 is only the weight
decay, and since they yield the same curve v2.6 completely hides v2.4, rendering it invisible
in the plot).
In conclusion, all of the runs (summarized in Figure 12) had the same outcome of
eventual flattening of the validation loss and sometimes even increasing the loss. We did
not observe that any particular change significantly improved the downstream evaluations
and validation loss (Table 20).
At this point, we had used 77% of our training data and were nearing the end of the
budget we had set aside for training. Combined with all of these observations and initial
promising results on the downstream benchmarks, we decided to end training despite not
having gone through all of our training data. Another motivating factor was the possibility
of using remaining unseen training data for subsequent runs of different styles of training
and finetuning.
Based on this experience, we plan to explore different options in future experiments
that have shown the potential to lead to more stable training for longer durations, in-
cluding SwiGLU activations (Shazeer, 2020), RoPE embeddings (Su et al., 2021b), and
normalization for queries and keys in the attention layers (Henry et al., 2020).
